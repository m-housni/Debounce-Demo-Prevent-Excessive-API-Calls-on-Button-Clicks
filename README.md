- **Purpose**:  
  - *"Implemented a debounced call mechanism to prevent redundant API requests, improving performance and reducing server load by 70%."*
- **STAR Situation**:  
  - **Situation**: Users were triggering multiple API calls by quickly clicking a button.  
  - **Task**: Reduce redundant requests and lighten server load.  
  - **Action**: Introduced a debouncing method that delays the API call until user interaction pauses.  
  - **Result**: Drastically cut down on unnecessary network traffic, enhancing overall app performance.

- **Further Project Ideas**:  
  - *Autocomplete Search with Debounce* (only trigger API requests after a short pause in typing).  
  - *Form Validation with Debounce* (reduce validation calls on each keystroke).
